# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose
Robin's web application looks and works fine, but she wants to add some polish. She had been looking at images of the Martian hemisphere online and found the site to be a great place to scrape. She wants to customize her current web application to include all four hemisphere images. To assist her, we will use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to grab full-resolution images of the Martian hemisphere and the captions for those images, store the grabbed data in a mongo database, display the data using a web application, and modify the designed web application to Take these photos.
